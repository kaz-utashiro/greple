This the is standard way to install, but still under construction.
Not recommended, yet.

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Easy and safe way is clone directory and make symbolic link in your
command directory.  The command recognizes library, so you don't have
to worry about that.

    $ git clone git@github.com:kaz-utashiro/greple.git
    $ ln -s $PWD/greple/bin/greple ~/bin

Or copy files manually to command and library directories.  Library
directory can be set in environment variable, of course.

    $ git clone git@github.com:kaz-utashiro/greple.git
    $ cp greple/bin/greple /usr/local/bin
    $ cp -rp greple/lib/* /usr/local/lib/perl
